%begin contents subsection -- {{{
\subsection{Contents}
This document contains one procedure:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \textit{Arm and Launch} procedure compromises steps for the igniter insertion, arming, and launching of a model rocket.
\end{itemize}

% begin personnel required section -- {{{
\subsection{Personnel Required}
The test operations team consists of four personnel:
\begin{checklist}
  \item The \opsfull{} directs operations procedures and communicates with the other test personnel. This should be a core team member.
  \item The \primaryfull{} performs actions at the launch site. This may be a participant.
  \item The \secondaryfull{} is the backup for \primary{}, and communicates with OPS. If \primary{} becomes incapacitated, \secondary{} is responsible for removing them from danger. This should be a core team member.
  \item the \controlfull{} operates the test control system, including actuation of remote valves and engine ignition. This may be a participant.
\end{checklist}

\subsection{Prior to Start}
\begin{checklist}
  \item Ensure that the following procedures are complete:
  \begin{checklist}
    \item Rocket Assembly procedure
    \item RLCS Setup procedure
  \end{checklist}
  \item Ensure that all personnel as defined above are available and have completed the sign-off.

\subsection{Prior to Arm and Launch}
\begin{checklist}
  \item Ensure that \primary{} and \secondary{} are wearing safety glasses.
  \item Ensure that \primary{} is in possession of an igniter and a plug.
  \item Ensure that \ops{} is in possession of the system control key.
  \item Ensure that the rocket is at the launch site.
  \item Confirm that there are no fire hazards within the testing area.
  \item Confirm that the cameras are set up at the correct locations.

\subsection{Arm and Launch}
\begin{checklist}
  \item \ops{}: Give the system control key to \primary{}.
  \item \primary{} and \secondary{}: Approach the launch site.
  \item \primary{}: Insert the system control key into towerside and rotate through 90 degrees, disarming the system.
  \item \secondary{}: Confirm that the ignition wires are not connected to the engine
  \item \secondary{} Confirm that the ignition wires are not connected to RLCS.
  \item \secondary{}: Confirm that there are no personnel present in the testing area other than \primary{} and \secondary{}.
  \item \primary{}: Insert the igniter into the bottom of the engine as deep as possible, spreading the leads. Insert the plug to hold the igniter in place.
  \item \primary{}: Load the rocket onto the launch rail.
  \item \primary{}: Connect the ignition alligator clips to the igniter leads. Confirm that the leads are not shorted.
  \item \primary{}: Connect the ignition connector to the RLCS ignition cable.
  \item \primary{}: Remove the system control key from towerside, arming the system.
  \item \primary{} and \secondary{}: Retreat to the mission control area. 
  \item \primary{}: Give the system control key to \ops{}.
  \item \control{}: Confirm that all actuator controls are in the "off" position:
  \begin{checklist}
    \item Primary Ignition
    \item Secondary Ignition
  \end{checklist}
  \item \ops{}: Poll the following personnel for GO/NO GO status:
  \begin{checklist}
    \item \secondary{}
    \item \primary{}
    \item \control{}
  \end{checklist}
  \item \ops{}: Give the system control key to \control{}.
  \item \control{}: Insert the system control key into clientside and rotate through 90 degrees, arming the system.
  \item \control{}: Perform the engine startup procedure:
  \begin{checklist}
    \item Arm the Primary Ignition switch.
    \item Hold down the Fire button until launch is observed.
    \begin{checklist}[label=$\bullet$]
      \item In the event of a failed ignition (launch not observed within 5 seconds):
      \begin{checklist}
        \item \control{}: Disarm the primary ignition switch.
        \item \control{}: Give the system control key to \primary{}.
        \item \primary{} and \secondary{}: Approach the launch site. 
        \item \primary{}: Insert the system control key into towerside and rotate through 90 degrees, disarming the system.
        \item \primary{}: Disconnect the ignition connectors from the RLCS ignition cable. 
        \item \ops{}: Abort test procedures and investigate.
      \end{checklist}
    \end{checklist}
  \end{checklist}
  \item \textbf{ALL}: Observe the launch. 
  \item \primary{} and \secondary{}: Approach the launch site. 
  \item \primary{}: Disconnect the ignition connectors from the RLCS ignition cable. 
  \item \ops{}: Proceed with teardown and disassembly.
