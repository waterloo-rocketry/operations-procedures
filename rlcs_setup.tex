\subsection{Required Items}
Things you'll need to perform this procedure
\begin{checklist}
    \item Client Side Box (yellow pelican case)
    \item Tower Side Box (silver briefcase thing)
    \item Three (3) Lithium Polymer 12V ignition batteries
    \item Multimeter
    \item Electrically actuated valve for inside setup
    \item Phillips head screwdriver
\end{checklist}
% end required items section -- }}}

% begin Inside Setup section -- {{{
\subsection{Inside Setup}
Do what you can inside to keep yourself from frostbite as much as possible.
\begin{checklist}
    \item Put two LiPo batteries in tower side box, in the white 3d printed 
battery holders.
    \item Make sure the actuator switch is off (big black one with a 1 and 0
painted on it), clicked to "0".
    \item Plug in both batteries. Lights on arduino should light up, relays
should click.
    \item Wire electric valve into the relay board labelled RFV (remote fill 
valve):
    \begin{checklist}
        \item Red wire screwed into V1
        \item Brown wire screwed into V2
        \item Black wire screwed into G1
        \item Green wire screwed into G2
        \item Make sure no wire strands are poking out of screw terminal
    \end{checklist}
    \item Turn on actuator switch:
    \begin{checklist}
        \item If remote valve previously wasn't closed, it should now close. If 
not, go to troubleshooting guide.
    \end{checklist}
    \item Put battery in client side box. It plugs into the deans connector
underneath the cutout, and isn't secured to anything (to be fixed).
    \item Turn on client side box (flip power switch).
    \begin{checklist}
        \item Confirm that LCD lights up.
    \end{checklist}
    \item Turn keyswitch 90 degrees clockwise.
    \begin{checklist}
        \item Confirm that missile switches light up.
    \end{checklist}
    \item Flip \rfill{} missile switch
    \begin{checklist}
        \item Confirm that Electrically actuated valve turns to open
    \end{checklist}

    \item Confirm that there is no voltage from V1 to G1 on ignition relay board
    \item Confirm that there is no voltage from V2 to G2 on ignition relay board
    \item Flip \priarm{} missile switch and depress fire button
    \begin{checklist}
        \item Confirm that there is 12V from V1 to G1 on ignition relay board
        \item Confirm that there is no voltage from V2 to G2 on ignition relay board
    \end{checklist}
    \item Have that person unflip \priarm{} switch and flip \secarm{} switch, 
and depress fire button
    \begin{checklist}
        \item Confirm that there is no voltage from V1 to G1 on ignition relay board
        \item Confirm that there is 12V from V2 to G2 on ignition relay board.
    \end{checklist}

    \item Disconnect electrically actuated valve from RFV relay board

End inside checks

        \item Brown wire screwed into V2
        \item Black wire screwed into G1
        \item Green wire screwed into G2
        \item Make sure no wire strands are poking out of screw terminal
    \end{checklist}
    \item Connect tank vent valve to relay board labelled RVV:
    \begin{checklist}
        \item Red wire screwed into V1
        \item Brown wire screwed into V2
        \item Black wire screwed into G1

    \item Ensure that ignition transmission cables are not connected to the rocket
    \item Connect ignition transmission cables to relay board labelled IGN:
    \begin{checklist}
        \item Primary coil wires to V1 and G1 (polarity is irrelevant)
        \item Secondary coil wires to V2 and G2 (polarity is irrelevant)
