\subsection{Contents}
This document contains two procedures:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textit{Fill System Check} procedure comprises steps for validating the integrity of the system plumbing and correct operation of the test data acquisition system, using carbon dioxide.
	\item The \textit{Static Fire Test} comprises steps for operating the fill system and conducting a static fire test of the engine. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personnel Required}
The test operations team consists of nine personnel:
\begin{checklist}
    \item The \opsfull{} directs operations procedures and communicates with the other test personnel.
    \item The \primaryfull{} operates all manual valves for the fill system.
    \item The \secondaryfull{} is the backup for \primary{}, and communicates with OPS. If \primary{} becomes incapacitated, \secondary{} is responsible for removing them from danger.
    \item The \daqfull{} monitors and operates the test data acquisition system.
    \item the \controlfull{} operates the test control system, including actuation of remote valves and engine ignition.
    \item \perifull{}, \periifull{}, \periiifull{}, and \perivfull{} ensure that no unauthorized personnel enter the testing area during test operations.
