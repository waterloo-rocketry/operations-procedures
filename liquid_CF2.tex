\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{Pressurant Regulation Test} procedure comprises steps for determining the proper setting of the flow control valves.
    \item The \textit{Fuel Flow Test} procedure comprises steps for conducting a flow test of the fuel components of the liquid engine.
    \item The \textit{Oxidizer Flow Test} procedure comprises steps for conducting a flow test of the oxidizer components of the liquid engine.

\subsection{Personnel Required}
The test operations team consists of nine personnel:
\begin{checklist}
    \item The \opsfull{} directs operations procedures and communicates with the other test personnel.
    \item The \primaryfull{} is the main system operator. \primary{} operates all manual valves. 
    \item The \secondaryfull{} is the backup for \primary{}, and communicates with OPS. If \primary{} becomes incapacitated, \secondary{} is responsible for removing them from danger.
    \item The \daqfull{} monitors and operates the test data acquisition system.
    \item The \controlfull{} operates the test control system, including actuation of the injector valve. 
    \item \perifull{}, \periifull{}, and \periiifull{} ensure that no unauthorized personnel enter the testing area during test operations.

\subsection{Background Information}
All personnel should familiarize themselves with the following information prior to test start:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All valves have two names: an alphanumeric code used in the plumbing master system, and a descriptive name used in control system code and documentation. For this test, the correspondence is as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item \textbf{BA-1} is the \textbf{Supply Valve}
	    \item \textbf{BA-2} is the \textbf{Supply Vent Valve}
	    \item \textbf{BA-3} is the \textbf{Fuel Pressurant Valve}
	    \item \textbf{BA-4} is the \textbf{Pressurant Vent Valve}
	    \item \textbf{BA-5} is the \textbf{Oxidizer Pressurant Valve}
	    \item \textbf{BA-6} is the \textbf{Oxidizer Vent Valve}
	    \item \textbf{IJ-1} is the \textbf{Injector Valve}
	    \item \textbf{SC} denotes a supply cylinder
	    \item \textbf{R} denotes a regulator
