The test operations team consists of seven personnel:
\begin{checklist}
    \item The \authfull{} writes a new procedure
    \item The \edifull{} reads this new procedure and approves it before it is used
    \item The \perffull{} Performs the actions laid out in the new procedure

\textit{To be completed by all test personnel after reading and familiarization with procedures}
\begin{checklist}

\subsection{Prior to Start}
\begin{checklist}
    \item Items to be completed before beginning procedure
    \begin{checklist}
        \item Make sure the \auth{} has a computer they can compile \LaTeX{} on, or has access to a website that can do so
        \item Make sure the \edi{} has been asked to review a new procedure (or do this after, I'm not a cop, do what you want)
        \item Make sure caffeine is available

\subsection{How to Make a New Procedure}
% syntax for the flag macro:
% arg1: The colour you want the flag to be
% this should be useful for abort procedures that we need to put sticky notes on for irec judges to happy for
% It prints the flag all the way over the right edge so the flag should be visible even in the middle of a stack of ops
\flag{blue}
\begin{checklist}
    \item \auth{} Copy this file (standard\_template.tex) to a new latex file (extension .tex)
    \item \auth{} Change the Document Title and Section title (which will appear at the top of the first page).
    \item \auth{} Create the operators that you'll need for your procedure (use the \\operators macro, it's super helpful)
    \item \auth{} Add those operators to the Personnel Required and Sign-Off sections
    \item \auth{} Write your checklists (this part is important, which is why there's a big red square on the right margin, so you can put one of those sticky note things there and flip to it easily). \flag{red}
    \item \auth{} Send to \edi{} for review
    \item \edi{} Edit the document. Compile it, commit it, whatever. Send to \perf{} so they can do the thing.
    \item \perf{} Do the thing in the procedure.
