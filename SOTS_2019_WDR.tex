\subsection{Contents}
This document contains the following procedures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{N1}, \textit{Final Setup and "Pre-Launch" Checks}, comprises partial rocket assembly and testing of avionics in full flight configuration
    \item \textbf{N2}, \textit{Fill Operations}, comprises propellant loading and off-loading
\end{itemize}
Additionally, this document contains five abort procedures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{A1}, \textit{Abort Procedure - Leak At Supply Plumbing}, is used if a plumbing leak is detected when the supply cylinder is initially opened.
    \item \textbf{A2}, \textit{Abort Procedure - Low Supply Pressure}, is used if the oxidizer pressure is below the acceptable limit for test purposes.
    \item \textbf{A3}, \textit{Abort Procedure - High Supply Pressure}, is used if the oxidizer pressure is above the acceptable limit for test purposes.
    \item \textbf{A4}, \textit{Abort Procedure - Leak At Fill Plumbing}, is used if a plumbing leak is detected during manual fill leak checks.
    \item \textbf{A5}, \textit{Abort Procedure - Remote Disconnect Failure}, is used if the remote disconnect system fails, necessitating a full vent of the oxidizer tank.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personnel Required}
The launch operations team consists of four personnel:
\begin{checklist}
    \item The \opsfull{} is stationed at Launch Control. \ops{} directs operations procedures and communicates with the other launch personnel.
    \item The \controlfull{} is stationed at Launch Control and is responsible for operation of RLCS, remote fill, and disconnect.
    \item The \primaryfull{} is initially stationed at the Launch Tower and carries out all tasks occurring at the Launch Tower. \primary{} engages the remote disconnect system, connects the ignition wires to the rocket, and operates all manual valves during the manual portion of fill.
    \item The \secondaryfull{} is the backup for \primary{}, and communicates with \ops{}. If \primary{} becomes incapacitated, \secondary{} is responsible for removing them from danger.
