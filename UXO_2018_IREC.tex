\subsection{Contents}
This document contains two nominal procedures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{N1}, \textit{Final Setup and Pre-Launch Checks}, comprises the final checks and tests performed on the Remote Launch Control System (RLCS) prior to rocket launch, as well as avionics systems arming.
    \item \textbf{N2}, \textit{Fill and Launch Operations}, comprises steps for oxidizer fill and rocket launch.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, this document contains five abort procedures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{A1}, \textit{Abort Procedure - Leak At Supply Plumbing}, is used if a plumbing leak is detected when the supply cylinder is initially opened.
    \item \textbf{A2}, \textit{Abort Procedure - Low Supply Pressure}, is used if the oxidizer pressure is below the acceptable limit for launch.
    \item \textbf{A3}, \textit{Abort Procedure - High Supply Pressure}, is used if the oxidizer pressure is above the acceptable limit for launch.
    \item \textbf{A4}, \textit{Abort Procedure - Leak At Fill Plumbing}, is used if a plumbing leak is detected during manual fill leak checks.
    \item \textbf{A5}, \textit{Abort Procedure - Remote Disconnect or Ignition Failure}, is used if the remote disconnect or ignition systems fail, necessitating a full vent of the oxidizer tank.
    \item \textbf{A\LARGE$\gamma$}, \textit{Abort Procedure - Voice Contact Loss}, is used if the operators at the launch site lose the ability to communicate with the operators at launch control.

\subsection{Personnel Required}
The launch operations team consists of four personnel:
\begin{checklist}
    \item The \opsfull{} is stationed at Launch Control. \ops{} directs operations procedures and communicates with the other launch personnel.
    \item The \controlfull{} is stationed at Launch Control and is responsible for operation of RLCS, including remote fill, disconnect, and ignition.
    \item The \primaryfull{} is initially stationed at the Launch Tower and carries out all tasks occurring at the Launch Tower. \primary{} engages the remote disconnect system, arms the vehicle recovery deployment system, connects the ignition wires to the rocket, and operates all manual valves during the manual portion of fill.
    \item The \secondaryfull{} is the backup for \primary{}, and communicates with \ops{}. If \primary{} becomes incapacitated, \secondary{} is responsible for removing them from danger.
