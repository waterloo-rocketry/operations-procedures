This document contains three procedures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{Fill System Check} procedure comprises steps for validating the integrity of the system plumbing and correct operation of the test data acquisition system, using carbon dioxide.
    \item The \textit{Static Fire Test – Remote Control} procedure comprises steps for operating the fill system using the electrical control system and motorized ball valves.
    \item The \textit{Static Fire Test – Manual Control} procedure comprises steps for operating the fill system using manually operated ball valves.

\subsection{Personnel Required}
The test operations team consists of eight personnel:
\begin{checklist}
    \item The \opsfull{} directs operations procedures and communicates with the other test personnel.
    \item The \primaryfull{} is the main system operator. \primary{} operates all manual valves as well as the test control system.
    \item The \secondaryfull{} is the backup for \primary{}, and communicates with OPS. If \primary{} becomes incapacitated, \secondary{} is responsible for removing them from danger.
    \item The \daqfull{} monitors and operates the test data acquisition system.
    \item The \heatfull{} operates the valves for the tank heating system.
    \item \perifull{}, \periifull{}, and \periiifull{} ensure that no unauthorized personnel enter the testing area during test operations.
